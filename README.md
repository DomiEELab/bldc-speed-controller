This was a group project. Arduino-based sensorless BLDC motor speed controller implementing PWM speed control and back-EMF feedback, tested on a standalone BLDC motor.
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a sensorless Brushless DC (BLDC) motor speed controller using an Arduino microcontroller. The goal of the project is to develop a standalone BLDC motor controller capable of regulating motor speed without using physical position sensors, relying instead on back electromotive force (back-EMF) feedback and PWM-based control techniques.

An ATmega328P-based Arduino board is used to generate PWM signals that drive a three-phase MOSFET inverter bridge, enabling electronic commutation of the BLDC motor. Motor speed is controlled by varying the PWM duty cycle, while the back-EMF signals generated by the motor phases are monitored to estimate rotor position and ensure accurate commutation timing. This sensorless approach eliminates the need for Hall sensors, reducing system complexity, cost, and wiring requirements.

The hardware design includes a MOSFET gate driver stage, voltage regulation circuitry, and protection components such as flyback diodes to safely handle inductive switching loads. A comparator circuit is used to process the back-EMF signals and assist in detecting zero-crossing events required for sensorless operation. The controller is designed to operate from a 12V DC supply and was tested on a standalone BLDC motor under varying speed conditions.

The firmware was developed using the Arduino IDE and implements:

PWM generation for motor speed control

Basic startup and six-step commutation logic

Back-EMF–based feedback for sensorless operation

Adjustable speed control using external user inputs

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of BLDC motor control principles, power electronics, embedded systems, and microcontroller-based motor control, serving as an educational implementation of a sensorless BLDC speed controller.

The system operates as a sensorless BLDC motor controller using an Arduino microcontroller, a three-phase MOSFET inverter, and back-EMF–based commutation.

The Arduino generates PWM and control signals that are supplied to IR2104 high-side/low-side gate driver ICs. These gate drivers control six MOSFETs arranged in a three-phase inverter bridge, which delivers the appropriate switching voltages to the BLDC motor phases (A, B, and C). At any given time, two motor phases are actively driven—one connected to the supply voltage and the other to ground—while the third phase remains floating.

Motor speed is regulated by adjusting the PWM duty cycle generated by the Arduino. Increasing the duty cycle raises the average voltage applied to the motor phases, resulting in higher speed, while decreasing it reduces speed. User inputs such as push buttons are used to dynamically adjust the duty cycle during operation.

For sensorless commutation, the controller monitors the back-EMF voltage generated on the floating motor phase. A resistor divider network scales the phase voltages to safe logic levels for processing. The back-EMF zero-crossing point is detected and used as feedback to estimate rotor position. Based on this information, the Arduino advances the commutation sequence at the appropriate time.

The motor is driven using a six-step commutation sequence, which produces a rotating magnetic field in the stator, causing smooth and continuous motor rotation. This method eliminates the need for Hall sensors while maintaining reliable speed control and efficient motor operation.

Overall, the project demonstrates the practical integration of embedded firmware, power electronics, PWM-based speed regulation, and back-EMF feedback to achieve sensorless BLDC motor control using an Arduino platform.
